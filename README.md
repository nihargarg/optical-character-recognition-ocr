# How to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

### Discover how to detect and OCR with OpenCV and Tesseract

### Implementations steps:
1. Take and save an image of the item (card/mailpiece/receipt) to be OCR'ed
* This step is not included in this repository, but is as simple as clicking a picture using a camera and saving it to the local machine
2. Preprocessing the input image using OpenCV:
* Apply edge detection to reveal the outline (detect the four corners) of the item in the image against the background
** This step works well if there is sufficient contrast between the background and foreground
* Detect contours in the edge map
* Loop over all contours and find the largest contour with four vertices (corners)
* Apply a perspective transform to obtain a top-down, birdâ€™s-eye view of the item (required to improve OCR accuracy)
3. OCR the text on the top-down transform of the item using Tesseract
* Extract data using Python regular expressions
* Display the results on our terminal and save to a text file

A special thank you to pyimagesearch for helping me learn and apply computer vision.

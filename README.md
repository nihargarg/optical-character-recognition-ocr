# How to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

### Discover how to detect and OCR with OpenCV and Tesseract

### Implementations steps:
1. Take and save an image of the item (card/mailpiece/receipt) to be OCR'ed
  * This step is not included in this repository, but is as simple as clicking a picture using a camera and saving it to the local machine
  ![name-select](./0-original.jpg)

2. Preprocessing the input image using OpenCV:
  * Apply edge detection to reveal the outline (detect the four corners) of the item in the image against the background
    * This step works well if there is sufficient contrast between the background and foreground
  ![name-select](./1-gray.jpg)
  ![name-select](./2-blurred.jpg)
  
  * Detect contours in the edge map
  ![name-select](./3-edged.jpg)
  
  * Loop over all contours and find the largest contour with four vertices (corners)
  ![name-select](./4-outline.jpg)
  
  * Apply a perspective transform to obtain a top-down, birdâ€™s-eye view of the item (required to improve OCR accuracy)
  ![name-select](./5-transformed.jpg)
  ![name-select](./6-rgb.jpg)
  ![name-select](./7-enhanced.jpg)

3. OCR the text on the top-down transform of the item using Tesseract
  * Extract data using Python regular expressions
  * Display the results on our terminal and save to a text file
